Hello
=====
I'm Ben Williams. It takes some of us awhile to figure out what we want to do. After a college career chock-full of political science, a year of teaching English in China, and a year of law school, I realized I wanted to be in information security. While I was more than computer literate before, dual booting ubuntu and Win7, hitting the Great Firewall opened my eyes. Sure, those that started off as script kiddies punking thier highschool got the jump on me, but I'd like to think my baptizm by state sponsored censorship gives me a more mature perspective.
